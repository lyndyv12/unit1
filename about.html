            <h3>Early Life and Career</h3>
            <p>Growing up in Kentucky, soccer was my life. I played through my school years and even into college. After graduation, I returned to my high school alma mater, but this time as a math teacher and coach. It was an incredibly rewarding experience to teach and give back to the community that shaped me and working alongside the teachers that inspired me into persuing the profession.</p>

            <h3>A Unique Detour</h3>
            <p>In a surprising twist, I found myself a couple years later working for a family friend's small business specializing in rhinestone bedazzling. It was a creative and fun-filled environment where I honed the art of 'wearing many hats' and attentiveness to detail - one rhinestone at a time!</p>

            <h3>Cross-Country Move No. 1</h3>
            <p>Eventually, I decided to pack up my belongings and make a bold move to Denver, Colorado. The journey was both exciting and nerve-wracking, but it led me to an amazing opportunity at Gusto. I've always admired Gusto and their mission to make a world where work empowers a better life. I've been in many roles over the years. Currently, I'm working as a Product Operations Manager and in a bootcamp to learn coding, a step toward my dream of becoming a software developer.</p>

            <h3>Cross-Country Move No. 2</h3>
            <p>After Covid I was still working remotely and it was time for my next big move. This time even more West! I once again packed my belongings and headed to Sunny San Diego where I still work remotely for Gusto and spend my weekends at the beach and hiking. The best of both worlds!
        
            <h3>My Inspiration</h3>
            <p>What inspired me to dive into coding and development? It’s the thrill of solving problems and creating products that enhance customer experiences. I believe that a great customer experience should start with an intuitive and user-friendly product and I want to help built that for our customers!</p>

            <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
            <p>My ultimate goal is to become a proficient software developer and continue to grow within Gusto. I’m excited about the future and eager to see where this path takes me.</p>

                <h3>Life Outside Work</h3>
                <p>When I'm not immersed in coding or working at Gusto, you'll find me with my boyfriend and dog. We love exploring beaches, hiking trails, and breweries.</p>

                <p>I can juggle and ride a unicycle! I have a twin brother. My bucket list includes visiting every national park and hiking Mt. Kilimanjaro.</li>
